## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Kali Linux (recommended) or any Debian-based Linux distribution
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 10GB free disk space
- Android device for testing (physical or emulator)

### Required Packages
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js and npm
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install Java (OpenJDK)
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk

# Install Android SDK tools
sudo apt install -y android-sdk android-sdk-platform-tools

# Install Git
sudo apt install -y git

# Install build tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential

# Install Python (for some dependencies)
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
```

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/lib/android-sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdalrohmanGitHub/AhMyth-AhMyth-Android-RAT.git
cd AhMyth-AhMyth-Android-RAT
```

### 2. Build Everything (Automated)
```bash
# Run the automated build script
./build_for_kali.sh
```

### 3. Manual Setup (Alternative)

#### Build Server Component
```bash
cd AhMyth-Server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for Linux
npm run build:linux64

# Or run directly without building
npm start
```

#### Build Android Client
```bash
cd ../AhMyth-Client

# Make gradlew executable
chmod +x gradlew

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (optional)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
cd AhMyth-Server
npm start
```
The server will start and open a web interface (typically at http://localhost:42474)

### Installing the APK on Android Device
```bash
# Connect Android device with USB debugging enabled
adb devices

# Install the APK
adb install ../AhMyth-Client/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Using AhMyth Interface
1. Open your browser to the server URL
2. The web interface will show:
   - **Dashboard**: Connected victims overview
   - **Lab**: Detailed victim management
   - **Build**: APK generation and customization

## üîß Configuration

### Server Configuration
The server configuration can be found in:
- `AhMyth-Server/app/main.js` - Main server logic
- `AhMyth-Server/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Android Client Configuration
- `AhMyth-Client/app/build.gradle` - Build configuration
- `AhMyth-Client/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - App permissions
- `AhMyth-Client/app/src/main/java/ahmyth/mine/king/ahmyth/` - Source code

### Customizing the APK
```bash
# Edit server IP in the Android client
# File: AhMyth-Client/app/src/main/java/ahmyth/mine/king/ahmyth/MainActivity.java
# Change the SERVER_IP variable to your server's IP address
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Fails
```bash
# Clear Gradle cache
cd AhMyth-Client
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies

# Clear npm cache
cd ../AhMyth-Server
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### 2. Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 14+

# Check if port 42474 is available
netstat -tulpn | grep 42474

# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f electron
```

#### 3. APK Won't Install
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on Android device
# Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging

# Check device connection
adb devices

# Install with force
adb install -r -d ../AhMyth-Client/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

#### 4. Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix permission issues
chmod +x AhMyth-Server/node_modules/.bin/electron
chmod +x AhMyth-Client/gradlew

# Run with sudo if needed (not recommended)
sudo npm start  # From AhMyth-Server directory
```

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
# Update npm and node
npm update -g npm
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall all dependencies
cd AhMyth-Server
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

cd ../AhMyth-Client
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### For Ethical Use
1. **Always get permission** before testing any device
2. **Use in isolated environments** (virtual machines, test devices)
3. **Document your testing** activities
4. **Follow responsible disclosure** practices

### Protecting Yourself
1. **Don't test on production devices**
2. **Use VPN** when testing remotely
3. **Keep your system updated**
4. **Use antivirus** on your development machine

## üìö Advanced Features

### Custom Payload Generation
```bash
# Generate custom APK with specific features
cd AhMyth-Server
npm start
# Use the web interface to customize and build APK
```

### Reverse Engineering
```bash
# Analyze the generated APK
apktool d ../AhMyth-Client/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk -o analysis/
jadx -d decompiled/ ../AhMyth-Client/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Network Analysis
```bash
# Monitor network traffic
tcpdump -i any port 42474
wireshark &
```
